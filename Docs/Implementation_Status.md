# AI-Assisted Consulting Tool Implementation Status

## Project Overview
We have made significant progress in developing an AI-powered tool to assist in problem decomposition, analysis, and solution generation for complex consulting projects. The tool maintains context throughout the development process and integrates various key features.

## Key Features Implementation Status

1. Problem input interface
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: Users can create, load, and manage problems through the Frontpage component.

2. LLM-driven problem decomposition
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Notes: The backend supports multi-step analysis, but further refinement is needed for comprehensive problem decomposition.

3. Interactive visualization of problem segments and dependencies
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Notes: Basic structure for displaying segments is in place, but advanced visualization needs to be developed.

4. Data capture and management for each segment
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: The backend supports creating, updating, and retrieving segments and their associated data.

5. Progress tracking and reporting
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Notes: Basic progress tracking is in place, but comprehensive reporting features need to be developed.

6. Assumption management and impact analysis
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: The system supports creating assumptions and performing Monte Carlo analysis.

7. Integration of literature reviews and data analysis
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: Literature review functionality has been added, including creation, updating, and integration with problem analysis.

8. Modular AI model selection
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Notes: UI for model selection is in place, but backend support for multiple models needs to be expanded.

## Technical Requirements Status

1. Frontend: Next.js with TypeScript
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: The frontend is built using Next.js and TypeScript, with components for various features.

2. Backend: Python
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: The backend is implemented using FastAPI, with models, schemas, and CRUD operations in place.

3. Deployment: Vercel
   - Status: Not Yet Implemented
   - Notes: Local development is complete, but production deployment needs to be set up.

4. AI Integration: Modular design to support multiple LLMs
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Notes: The system currently supports one AI model. Expansion to support multiple models is needed.

5. Database: Flexible schema
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: The database schema supports various problem types and data structures.

6. API: RESTful design
   - Status: Implemented
   - Notes: RESTful API endpoints are in place for communication between frontend, backend, and AI models.

7. Security: Robust data protection and user authentication
   - Status: Partially Implemented
   - Notes: Basic security measures are in place, but comprehensive user authentication and data protection need to be implemented.

## Next Steps

1. Enhance the interactive visualization of problem segments and dependencies.
2. Develop comprehensive reporting features for progress tracking.
3. Expand backend support for multiple AI models.
4. Implement user authentication and enhance data protection measures.
5. Set up production deployment on Vercel.
6. Develop and implement more advanced context maintenance strategies.
7. Enhance error handling and add more comprehensive testing.
8. Implement real-time updates for collaborative work.
9. Develop user documentation and training materials.

## Conclusion

The AI-Assisted Consulting Tool has made significant progress in implementing key features and meeting technical requirements. The core functionality for problem management, analysis, and literature review is in place. However, there are still areas that need further development, particularly in visualization, advanced AI model support, and production-ready security measures. The next phase of development should focus on these areas to fully realize the tool's potential as outlined in the original project brief.
