# Complex Scenario Example: Global Supply Chain Optimization

## Problem Statement

A multinational corporation operating in 20 countries across 5 continents is facing challenges with its global supply chain. The company needs to optimize its supply chain to reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance sustainability while maintaining product quality and meeting customer demands.

## Analysis Steps

1. Data Collection and Integration
   - Gather data from all 20 countries on inventory levels, transportation costs, manufacturing capacities, and demand forecasts
   - Integrate data from various sources (ERP systems, IoT devices, third-party logistics providers)

2. Supply Chain Network Mapping
   - Create a visual representation of the entire supply chain network
   - Identify key nodes (manufacturing plants, distribution centers, major customers)
   - Map transportation routes and modes

3. Demand Forecasting
   - Analyze historical sales data and market trends
   - Develop machine learning models for accurate demand prediction
   - Account for seasonality and regional variations

4. Inventory Optimization
   - Analyze current inventory levels and holding costs
   - Determine optimal safety stock levels for each location
   - Implement just-in-time inventory strategies where applicable

5. Transportation Route Optimization
   - Analyze current transportation routes and costs
   - Identify opportunities for consolidation and mode shifting
   - Develop algorithms for dynamic route optimization

6. Manufacturing Capacity Analysis
   - Assess current manufacturing capacities and utilization rates
   - Identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies
   - Explore opportunities for load balancing and capacity sharing between facilities

7. Sustainability Assessment
   - Calculate current carbon footprint of the supply chain
   - Identify opportunities for reducing environmental impact
   - Analyze potential for incorporating renewable energy and sustainable packaging

8. Risk Analysis
   - Identify potential disruptions (natural disasters, geopolitical events, supplier failures)
   - Develop contingency plans and resilience strategies
   - Quantify potential impacts and mitigation costs

9. Cost-Benefit Analysis
   - Calculate potential savings from proposed optimizations
   - Estimate implementation costs and ROI for each initiative
   - Prioritize initiatives based on impact and feasibility

10. Implementation Roadmap
    - Develop a phased approach for implementing optimizations
    - Create timelines and allocate resources
    - Establish KPIs and monitoring mechanisms
